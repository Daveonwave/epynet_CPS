# Epynet_CPS
Optimal Real-Time Control of Water Distribution Systems undergoing Cyber-attacks, exploiting Reinforcement Learning techniques.
In particular, we tested the robustness of DQN acting with an altered observation space by an adversarial MITM agent. <br>
The project is the prosecution of the M.Sc. thesis at Polytechnic of Milan.
