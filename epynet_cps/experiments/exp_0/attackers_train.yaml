# RANDOM ATTACK FORMAT
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Attack properties:
#   - enable: allows the attacker to be strike the current simulation
#   - attacker_presence_chance: guarantees the presence of that attack in an episode depending on
#     the provided percentage
#   - duration: describes how much time the attack will last
#   - max_occurrences: maximum amount of times that the attacker can strike in an episode
